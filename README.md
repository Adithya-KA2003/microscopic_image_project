Microscope Image Processing API Documentation
---------------------------------------------
Overview
--------
This Flask API processes microscope images, enabling functionalities like image stitching, Region of Interest (ROI) extraction, digital zooming, and auto-focus simulation. It uses Flask for the backend and OpenCV for image processing.

Approach Taken
--------------

Image Stitching:
-The API uses the ORB algorithm to detect keypoints and descriptors in overlapping microscope images.
-Keypoints are matched using the Brute-Force Matcher, and a homography matrix aligns the images.
-Images are stitched together using perspective warping.

ROI Extraction:
-Users specify an ROI using (x, y, width, height) coordinates.
-The API extracts the ROI from the stitched image for further processing.

Digital Zooming:
-The API zooms into the center of the ROI and magnifies it by 10X or 20X.
-Lanczos interpolation is used to maintain image quality.

Auto-Focus Simulation:
-The API measures image sharpness using Laplacian variance.
-If the image is blurry (low variance), a sharpening filter is applied.

Challenges Faced
-----------------

Image Stitching:
Challenge: Stitching failed with insufficient overlapping areas or poor feature matching.
Solution: Added error handling to return meaningful messages.

Digital Zooming:
Challenge: Initial zooming simply resized the entire image.
Solution: Updated the logic to focus on a specific area (e.g., the center).

Auto-Focus:
Challenge: Determining the optimal Laplacian variance threshold for sharpening.
Solution: Settled on a threshold of 100 after testing.

Performance:
Challenge: Processing large images was slow.
Solution: Optimized code and used efficient OpenCV functions.

Optimizations Applied
----------------------
Efficient Image Processing:
Used OpenCV's high-performance functions for zooming and resizing.
Applied sharpening only when necessary.

Modular Code Design:
Separated image processing logic into a separate module for better maintainability.

Error Handling:
Added error handling for invalid inputs and provided meaningful error messages.

Scalability:
Saved processed images to disk to avoid reprocessing.

Conclusion
------------
This API provides a robust solution for processing microscope images, focusing on usability, performance, and scalability. It addresses challenges and applies optimizations to deliver accurate and efficient results.
